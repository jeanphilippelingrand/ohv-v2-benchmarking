Just an express server to get personalized recommendations with different managers

to use it:
`yarn`
`yarn dev`

this will start the server on port 3000

then hit the route /relational or /non-rational to get recommendations using the relational or the non-relational adapter.

the rational adapter is using a postgresql database. 
the non-rational adapter is using a dynamodb database.
